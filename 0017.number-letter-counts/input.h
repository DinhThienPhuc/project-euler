// If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words : one, two, three, four, five.
// There are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

// If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words.
// How many letters would be used ?

// Do not count spaces or hyphens.
// For example: 342(three hundred and forty - two) contains 23 letters and 115(one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
// The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
